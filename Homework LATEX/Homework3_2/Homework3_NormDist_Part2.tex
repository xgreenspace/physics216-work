	A soft-drink machine is regulated so that it discharges an average of 200 millimeters per cup. If the amount of drink is normally distributed with a standard deviation equal to 15 millimeters,
	\\
	
	(a) What fraction of the cups will contain more than 224 millimeters?
	\\ \\
	(b) What is the probability that a cup contains between 191 and 209 millimeters?
	\\ \\
	(c) How many cups will probability overflow if 230 millimeter cups are used for the next 1000 drinks?
	\\ \\
	(d) Below what value do we get the smallest 25\% of the drinks?
	\\ \\
	
	\textbf{\underline{Given}}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\mu =$ 200 millimeters per cup
		\item $\sigma =$ 15 millimeters
	\end{itemize}
	
	\textbf{\underline{Find}}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The fraction of cups that will contain more than 224 millimeters.
		\item The probability that a cup contains between 191 and 209 millimeters.
		\item The probability that the cups will overflow, assuming 230 millimeter cups are used for the next 1,000 drinks.
		\item The amount at the 25th percentile of drinks.

	\textbf{\underline{Theory}}
	\\
	\\
	To find the probability of a measurement containing a certain value, assuming that the samples follow a normal distribution, the $z$-value must be found with the following equation so that it may be used with the proper $z$-table.
	
	\[
	z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
	\]
	
	Since under some circumstances the probability may be known but the actual value may be unknown, it's necessary to use the $z$-table and the equation to work backwards and find $x$.
	\\
	
	\textbf{\underline{Assumptions}}
	\\
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The curve follows a normal distribution and can be therefore described by $N(200, (15)^2)$
	\end{itemize}

	
	
	\textbf{\underline{Solution}}
	\\
	
	\textbf{Part A}
	\\
	
	First, the $z$ value needs to be calculated using the aforementioned equation.
	
	\[
	\begin{split}
		z &= \frac{224-200}{15}
		\\
		&= 1.6
	\end{split}
	\]
	
	Plug in the value into the $z$-table to get a new value of 0.9452. Take this value and subtract it from 1.0 to get a final answer.
	
	\[
	\begin{split}
		P(x < 224) &= 1 - P(z < 1.6)
		\\
		&= 1 - 0.9452
		\\
		&= \doubleunderline{0.0548}
	\end{split}
	\]
	\\
	
	\textbf{Part B}
	\\
	
	To find the probability that a cup contains between 191 and 209 millimeters, find the $z$-value for the two numbers.
	\\
	First, find $z_1$
	
	\[
	\begin{split}
		z_1 &= \frac{191 - 200}{15}
		\\
		&= -0.6
	\end{split}
	\]
	
	Next, find $z_2$
	
	\[
	\begin{split}
	z_1 &= \frac{209 - 200}{15}
	\\
	&= 0.6
	\end{split}
	\]
	
	Use the $z$-values to find and calculate the probability.
	
	\[
	\begin{split}
		P(191 < x < 209) &= P(-0.6 < z < 0.6)
		\\
		&= P(z < 0.6) - P(z < -0.6)
		\\
		&= 0.7257 - 0.2743
		\\
		&= \doubleunderline{0.4514}
	\end{split}
	\]
	
	\textbf{Part C}
	\\
	
	First, calculate the $z$ value.
	
	\[
	\begin{split}
		z_1 &= \frac{230 - 200}{15}
		\\
		&= 2.0
	\end{split}
	\]
	
	Plug in the value into the $z$-table to get a new value of 2.0. Take this value and subtract it from 1.0 to get the probability.
	
	\[
	\begin{split}
	P(x > 230) &= 1 - P(z > 2.0)
	\\
	&= 1 - 0.9772
	\\
	&= 0.0228
	\end{split}
	\]
	
	Now, multiply the probability by the 1,000 cups used. To find the amount of cups that will overflow.
	
	\[
	\begin{split}
		\unit{Ans} &= (0.0228)(1000)
		\\
		&= \doubleunderline{22.8}
	\end{split}
	\] 
	
	
	\textbf{Part D}
	\\
	
	This problem will need to be worked backwards. Find the number closest to .2500 on the $z$-table to find the corresponding $z$-value which is -0.67. Use the listed equation to find the measurement at the smallest 25\% of drinks or $x$.
	
	\[
	\begin{split}
		\frac{x - 200}{15} &= -0.67
		\\
		x - 200 &= (-0.67)(15)
		\\
		x &= (-0.67)(15) + 200
		\\
		x &= \doubleunderline{189.95}
	\end{split}
	\]
	
	\textbf{\underline{Conclusion}}
	\\
	
	\textbf{Part A}
	\\
	
	The probability that a cup will contain over 224 millimeters is \boxed{5.48\%.}
	\\
	
	\textbf{Part B}
	\\
	
	The probability that a cup will contain between 191 and 209 millimeters is \boxed{45.14\%.}
	\\
	
	\textbf{Part C}
	\\
	
	When rounded, the amount of cups that will overflow is \boxed{23.}
	\\
	
	\textbf{Part D}
	\\
	
	The measurement at the lowest 25\% is \boxed{189.95 \unit{millimeters}.}

\begin{homeworkProblem}
	
	A lawyer commutes daily from his suburban home to his midtown office. On the average the trip one way takes 24 minutes, with the standard deviation of 3.8 minutes. Assume the distribution of trip times to be normally distributed.
	\\
	
	(a) What is the probability that a trip will take at least 1/2 hour?
	\\ \\
	(b) If the office opens at 9:00 A.M. and he leaves his house at 8:45 A.M. daily, what percentage of the time is he late for work?
	\\ \\

	\end{itemize}
	
	
	
	\textbf{\underline{Solution}}
	\\
	
	\textbf{Part A}
	\\
	
	First, the $z$ value needs to be calculated using the aforementioned equation.
	
	\[
	\begin{split}
	z &= \frac{30 - 24}{3.8}
	\\
	&= 1.58
	\end{split}
	\]
	
	Plug in the value into the $z$-table to get a new value of 0.9429. Take this value and subtract it from 1.0 to get a final answer.
	
	\[

	\\
	&= 1 - 0.9429

	&= \doubleunderline{0.0571}
	\end{split}
	\]
	
	\textbf{Part B}
	\\
	
	First, the $z$ value needs to be calculated using the aforementioned equation. Since the lawyer is ``late" if he takes over 15 minutes, 15 will be plugged in as $x$.
	
	\[
	\begin{split}
	z &= \frac{15 - 24}{3.8}
	\\
	&= -2.37

	Plug in the value into the $z$-table to get a new value of 0.0089. Take this value and subtract it from 1.0 to get a final answer.
	
	\[

	P(x > 15) &= 1 - P(z > -2.37)

	\textbf{Part C}
	\\
	
	First, the $z$ value needs to be calculated using the aforementioned equation. Since the lawyer is ``late" if he takes over 25 minutes, 25 will be plugged in as $x$.
	
	\[
	\begin{split}
	z &= \frac{25 - 24}{3.8}
	\\
	&= 0.26
	\end{split}
	\]
	
	Plug in the value into the $z$-table to get a new value of 0.6026. Take this value and subtract it from 1.0 to get a final answer.
	
	\[
	\begin{split}
	P(x > 15) &= 1 - P(z > 0.26)
	\\
	&= 1 - 0.6026

	&= \doubleunderline{0.3974}

	\textbf{Part D}
	\\
	
	This problem will need to be worked backwards. Find the number closest to .8500 on the $z$-table to find the corresponding $z$-value which is 1.04. Use the listed equation to find the time at the shortest 15\% of trip duration or $x$.
	
	\[
	\begin{split}
	\frac{x - 24}{3.8} &= 1.04
	\\
	x - 24 &= (1.04)(3.8)
	\\
	x &= (1.04)(3.8) + 24
	\\
	x &= \doubleunderline{27.952}
	\end{split}
	\]
	
	\textbf{Part E}
	\\
	
	Using the final answer from Part A, 0.0571, the possibility of the trip taking at least 30 minutes can be found using binomial distribution, as shown.
	
	\[
	\begin{split}
		P(x) &= \frac{n!}{(n - x)!x!} p^x q^{n-x}
		\\
	\end{split}
	\] 
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $n$ is the total number of trips
		\item $x$ is the number of trips that last at least 30 minutes
		\item $p$ is 0.0571
		\item $q = p - 1$ is the probability that a trip lasts less than 30 minutes. 
	\end{itemize}

	Now, plug in all of the variables and evaluate.
	
	\[
	\begin{split}
	P(2) &= \frac{3!}{(3 - 2)! \times 2!} (0.0571)^2 (1 - 0.0571)^{3-2}
	\\
	&= \doubleunderline{0.0092}
	\end{split}
	\] 
	
	
	
	\textbf{\underline{Conclusion}}
	\\
	
	\textbf{Part A}
	\\
	
	The probability that the trip will take 30 minutes is \boxed{5.71\%.}
	\\
	
	\textbf{Part B}
	\\
	
	The lawyer is late to work \boxed{99.11\%} of the time.
	\\
	
	\textbf{Part C}
	\\
	
	The lawyer has a \boxed{0.3974\%} chance of being late for coffee.

\begin{homeworkProblem}
	
	The average life of a certain type of small motor is 10 years with a standard deviation of 2 years. The manufacturer replaces free all motors that fail while under guarantee. If he is willing to replace only 3\% of the motors that fail, how long a guarantee should he offer? Assume that the lives of the motors follow a normal distribution.
	\\
	
	\textbf{\underline{Given}}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\mu =$ 10 years
		\item $\sigma =$ 2 years
		\item The manufacturer only wants to replace 3\% of motors.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\textbf{\underline{Find}}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item How long should the guarantee be if the manufacturer wishes to only replace 3\% of all motors.
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{\underline{Theory}}
	\\
	
	To find the probability of a measurement containing a certain value, assuming that the samples follow a normal distribution, the $z$-value must be found with the following equation so that it may be used with the proper $z$-table.
	
	\[
	z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
	\]
	
	Since under some circumstances the probability may be known but the actual value may be unknown, it's necessary to use the $z$-table and the equation to work backwards and find $x$.
	\\
	
	\textbf{\underline{Assumptions}}
	\\
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The curve follows a normal distribution and can be therefore described by $N(10, (2)^2)$
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\textbf{\underline{Solution}}
	\\
	
	This problem will need to be worked backwards. Find the number closest to .0300 on the $z$-table to find the corresponding $z$-value which is -1.88. Use the listed equation to find 3\% of the motors with the shortest lifespan or $x$.
	
	\[
	\begin{split}
	\frac{x - 10}{2} &= -1.88
	\\
	x - 10 &= (-1.88)(2)
	\\
	x &= (-1.88)(2) + 10
	\\
	x &= \doubleunderline{6.24}
	\end{split}
	\]
	
	\textbf{\underline{Conclusion}}
	\\
	
	The manufacturer warranty should last \boxed{6.24 \unit{years}.}
